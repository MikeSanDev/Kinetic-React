                            <p>When humans walk, they actually put a fair amount of energy into the surface of which they are
                                moving on. After looking at many studies we found the range to be 50-67 Watts based on specific
                                variables (weight, speed, etc.). Now this isn’t enough power to power streetlights or buildings
                                but it is enough to be useful in our daily lives. </p>

                            <p> Although many people have tried making an energy harvesting shoe before (as demonstrated by the
                                hundreds of patents on these types of devices) there isn’t a product like ours on the market!
                                This isn’t because of manufacturing or market reasons, but simply because no one has <span><strong>gotten enough power.</strong></span>

                                by doing nothing more than what they would normally do. Imagine never having to check the
                                battery on your phone when you leave for work in the morning. Never having to carry around a
                                bulky power brick and a cable just so you can wait in line for that concert. All of these and
                                more become possible. </p>
