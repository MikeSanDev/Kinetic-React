                            <p>Did you know that when you walk, your footsteps generate a significant amount of energy that is absorbed by the surface beneath your feet? While this energy may not be enough to power large buildings or streetlights, it can certainly be harnessed to power smaller devices in our daily lives </p>

                            <p> Despite the fact that many attempts have been made to create energy harvesting shoes (as evidenced by the hundreds of patents on such devices), there isn't a product quite like ours on the market today. While other attempts have fallen short due to insufficient power output, our innovative design overcomes this challenge, providing ample power to keep you connected on the go.
